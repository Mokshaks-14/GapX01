# GapX AI - Skill Gap Intelligence Platform

GapX AI is an AI-driven Career Readiness & Skill Gap Analysis platform designed to help students transition from college-level fundamentals to placement readiness in tier-1 tech firms.

## Project Features

1. **Dashboard & Analytics**: Premium dark theme dashboards styled with custom glassmorphism. Evaluates metrics such as placement probability matching, resume ATS metrics, LeetCode question counts, and XP levels.
2. **AI Resume scoring**: Interactive analyzer which extracts details from PDF files or forms to calculate ATS rating, listing technical strengths/weaknesses and missing keywords.
3. **Dynamic Roadmap tree**: Personalized 8-stage preparation paths that check-off completed topics and update your readiness metrics dynamically.
4. **AI study notes**: Instantly compiles academic study sheets containing diagrams, definitions, code blocks, and FAQs into beautifully formatted PDF notes.
5. **Coding Workspace (LeetCode Clone)**: Live IDE console supporting Java, C++, JS, and Python execution with syntax validation, test verification, and real-time AI tutor hint debugging.
6. **Mock Interview & Behavior Mesh**: Web-cam video analyzer simulator which checks smile indexes, stress coordinates, attention metrics, and feeds conversational queries question-by-question.
7. **AI Career mentor bot**: Empathetic placement counselor bot responding to negotiation tips, technical guidelines, or project suggestions.

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### 1. Backend Server Setup
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system.

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Create a python virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment (Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install necessary python modules
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Setup Environment Variables (Optional)
Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` folder:
```env
# Optional: Add Google Gemini or OpenAI Key for real AI generation (otherwise robust fallback mock is used)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key

# Optional: RapidAPI Judge0 endpoint keys (otherwise local subprocess engine runs Python code)
JUDGE0_API_KEY=your-judge0-key
```

#### Start FastAPI Server
```bash
# Run server using uvicorn
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```
* Interactive API Documentation will be available at: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
